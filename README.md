# 8_white_dots_to_8_black_dotes
This is a learning project. I'm trying to learn how to make simple programms in python with UI.
Using a tkinter in this one. 
Making a game that I dont know the name of. But its about changing 8 things from one state to another, rules is if one is flipped< then two(each one on different side) flips too.
